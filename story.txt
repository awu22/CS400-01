Once upon a time, there was a dude named Jeff. Jeff was on a walk along Lake Menona with his girlfriend Jessa when he decided to jump into it, despite the fact that he couldn't swim. When he jumped in, he saw something spectacular! There was something shiny deeper in the water! 
Jeff scrambled down to it, moving his arms about furiously trying to figure out how to move himself in the water. Eventually, he was in reach of the object and slid his hand between the rocks and pulled out a shining stone. The stone's glow flooded the murky waters, and Jeff began to feel he had gained a new power...
The stone was, indeed, part of a wedding ring! With it, he felt new determination to swim back up to the surface. He flapped his wings wildly in an attempt to float his way up, but in the end Jessa had to save him. After reaching land, Jeff proposed with the muddy ring! Jessa said no, because Jeff is not very bright.
