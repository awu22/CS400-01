Once upon a time, there was a dude named Jeff. Jeff was on a walk along Lake Menona with his girlfriend Jessa when he decided to jump into it, despite the fact that he couldn't swim. When he jumped in, he saw something spectacular! There was something shiny deeper in the water! So, Jeff came back up for air, and when he went back down, he tried going deeper. He had really long arms, so he was able to reach the shiny thing. It was the most beautiful wedding ring he'd ever seen! So Jeff came up to the surface and decided to ask Jessa to marry him -- it was the perfect opportunity! But when he popped the question, she turned away in embarassment. Jeff took this as a sign that she would reject him, so he decided to make it easier for both of them, by jumping back into the lake and getting eaten by a shark. (yes there are sharks in lake menona)
